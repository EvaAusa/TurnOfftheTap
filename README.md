# TurnOfftheTap
A mobile web application for COMP 2910 (Project Course).

## The Water
In Metro Vancouver, lots of people don't know that many daily activities waste a ton of water everyday.

## The Game
Our game aims to educate users on water conservation with a simple and fun game that shows how small water wasting actions can lead to a dangerous outcome over time.

## The Team
Team 27 (Viva la Avocado) consists of 5 friends from set A, each with a different set of unique qualities and skills.

<b>Completion</b>
We 100% completed our minimum requirements but there are some optimization and bug fixes that we would've liked to have had done.

<b>Challenges</b>
We had difficulties learning how to properly use both Git and the Scrum sheets. More dilligent use of the scrum
sheet would have improved our team communication and resulted in a more efficient production cycle. Successfully using
Git was verry difficult during the initial weeks of the project and there were severall cases of lost work and bad merges. 
However by the end of the term we were able to get the hang of the git workflow and there were few issues. We also struggled 
with the use of new technology, specifically Javascript and Firebase. All of us were weak in Javascript so it took sometime
to become comfortable with it as our primary language, however our framework Phaser was intuitive and easy to apply for the 
purposes of our game. Firestore gave us issues with regards to asynchronus requests. Making sure the database properly finished
its save/load calls was something we struggled with right until the end of the project. Lastly our time management/task priority 
had some minor flaws. Overall we worked well but there are some polish features such as platform optimization that would have
benefited the project that we did not complete in lieu of adding new features/working no other tasks.

<b>Bugs</b>
<ul>
    <li>If the database connection is too long pages will load without completion of saving/loading from the database</li>
    <li>Season sometimes changes after pausing/entering minigame</li>
    <li>Game starts improperly zoomed on some mobile devices</li>
    <li>Very long loading time for game start</li>
    <li>Poor preformance on some devices</li>
</ul>
